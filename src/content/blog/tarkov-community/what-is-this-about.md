Hello there!

Tarkov is a shortened name of the video game [Escape From Tarkov](escapefromtarkov.com/), which is a hardcore tactical first-person extraction-based shooter. It's an incredibly difficult game with a huge learning curve - and also has communications issue between the developers and the community. The key issue is:

> The developers communicate important changes primarily through Twitter and occasional YouTube videos.

Which isn't ideal, because not everyone wants to get their updates on a video game through a separate social media platform.

## The Project Vision

As an avid gamer who has spent considerable time in Tarkov, I saw an opportunity. Together with my friend ThatFriendlyGuy, we envisioned creating a single source of information - one unified location for official Tarkov news. This project would not only serve the community but also give me a chance to experiment with APIs and dive back into web development!

### Stage Uno: Basic Implementation

- Built a basic solution and UI using iFrames from Facebook + Twitter
- Developed a JS + CSS solution for dynamic YouTube section dropdown
- Created a foundational UI structure with iFrame integration

### Stage Drei: Development Evolution

- Implemented proper branch management (master/development separation)
- Created UX branch for Tweet templating and dropdown solutions
- Developed YouTube API integration from scratch
- Designed a video display system with featured video and thumbnails
- Explored Twitter API integration (ultimately abandoned due to free tier limitations)

### Stage Oh-No-I-Broke-It: Merge Conflicts

- Encountered significant challenges merging API and master branches
- Dealt with .gitignore-related merge conflicts
- Eventually resolved issues through force merging and cleanup

### Stage Lets-Fix-It: Recovery and Enhancement

- Established new development workflow with proper branching
- Implemented code cleanup and conflict resolution
- Added interactive features:
  - Image maps and clickable areas
  - Bootstrap Alerts for event announcements
  - End of wipe event notifications

## Moving Forward

This project represents the intersection of gaming passion and technical implementation. While we've made significant progress, there's always room for improvement and new features to better serve the Tarkov community.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to evolve this platform! ðŸŽ®ðŸš€
